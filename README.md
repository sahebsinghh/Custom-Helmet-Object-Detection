# Custom Helmet Detection using YOLOv5

This is a custom object detection project that uses YOLOv5 and Roboflow for data annotation and preparing the custom dataset.

## Introduction

In this project, we have used YOLOv5, an object detection algorithm that has shown great results in detecting various objects. We have trained our own custom model to detect helmets in images. The custom dataset was prepared using Roboflow, an easy-to-use platform for data annotation and preparation.

## Installation

To run this project, you will need to install the following dependencies:

- PyTorch
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- YOLOv5
