# Custom Helmet Detection using YOLOv8 ðŸª–

This GitHub repository contains the code and instructions to create a custom object detection model for helmet detection using YOLOv8 and Roboflow.
This project uses Roboflow for data annotation and preparing the custom dataset.

## Introduction

In this project, we have used YOLOv8, a single stage object detection algorithm that has shown great results in detecting various objects. We have trained our own custom model to detect helmets in images as well as videos.

### [Roboflow](https://roboflow.com/)

Roboflow is an end-to-end computer vision platform that helps you to 
- Annotate, and create datasets quickly and easily with bounding boxes or other object detection labels, and export the dataset in a format that can be used to train     your model. 
- Collaborate with your team on computer vision projects.
- Export, train, and deploy computer vision models.  


## Getting Started

To get started, you will need to create an account on Roboflow and have the following dependencies installed on your system:

- [Python  3.8+](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [PyTorch 1.7+](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/)
- [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/)
- [YOLOv8](https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics)
